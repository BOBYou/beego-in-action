Front end frameworks and libraries such as Ember, Angular, and Backbone are part of a trend towards richer, more sophisticated web application clients. As a consequence of this, server-side components are unburdened from many of their traditional responsibilities, in essence becoming more like API’s. This API approach allows a greater decoupling of the traditional “front end” and “back end” parts of an application. One set of developers can build the back end independently from the front end engineers, with the additional benefit that testing becomes simpler. This approach also makes it much easier to build, say, a mobile application that shares the same back end as your web application.
